This semester, I am teaching BUAD 310g as well as GSBA 604. All my class notes and lecture slides are available from their respective course-homes in <a href='http://blackboard.usc.edu'><i><font face="verdana" color="teal"><i>blackboard</i></font></i></a> -- USC's e-learning platform. Please look at the class syllabi and blackboard announcements for all other information regarding these classes. Also, if you feel the need to shoot an email to me regarding your class, please use the email address for that particular class (as told in class). I keep different emails for the different classes I teach and they are different from my USC or Marshall email.
