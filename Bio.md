# Research Summary

I am interested in developing new statistical theories and perspectives that enhance our understanding on the working principles of popular data mining hacks and algorithms. Nowadays, data analysts are increasingly using innovative techniques to address the fundamental estimation and prediction challenges associated with big-data problems. Theoretical analysis of  these methods is very important for disciplined development of algorithms in these new age problems. In this context, I study the methods used for predictive modelling and analyze how these prediction problems differ from traditional estimation frameworks and why algorithm specifically geared for prediction should be used for predictive analysis. Another interesting attribute here involves checking the statistical consistency of the decision rules in high dimensions as increasing number of parameters are used for modeling.  We often use the minimal worst-case  (minimax) risk as the benchmark  for comparing the prediction accuracy of these methods. These theoretical analysis has lead to the formulation of new Bayes and empirical Bayes methods with optimal frequentist properties in estimation and prediction problems.  

I am also interested in developing novel statistical methods for emerging application areas in business and sciences. Over years, blessed by wonderful collaborators I have been introduced to statistical modeling in single-cell biology, inventory management and recently in marketing. These new age big-data applications of statistical methods needs incorporating novel notions of shrinkage for constructing robust algorithms and predictors. The concept of shrinkage is important because it provides an elegant framework for combining information and structures from related populations and often leads to substantial improvements in the performances of algorithms used for simultaneous inference.  
Here, I am mainly involved with two-sample inferences, data-driven segmentations and dynamic predictions in problems which are compounded with heterogeniety and sparsity issues.  

These two dual trajectories usually bootstrap each other stimulating interesting new research questions in either domains. Below is an itemized list of the sub-topics of interest: 

** Statistics Theory: ** 

  Predictive Inference 
    Predictive Density Estimation
    Impact of Loss functions on optimality of predictors;
  Decision Theory 
    Empirical Bayes 
    Minimax theory
    Sparse Estimation theory

<b>Research Interests:</b>  
My research interests include high-dimensional statistics, empirical Bayes &amp shrinkage methods, penalized regression and statistical prediction analysis. I am particularly interested in formulating new Bayes and empirical Bayes methods with optimal frequentist properties in estimation and prediction problems. I am also involved in developing novel statistical algorithms for big-data applications in health-care and management sciences. These applications involves two-sample inferences, data-driven segmentations and dynamic predictions which are again compounded with heterogeniety and sparsity issues.
