I graduated from Stanford University with a Statistics phd after defending [this thesis](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gourab/gourab-thesis.pdf). I was advised by Professor [Iain Johnstone](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~imj/). My dissertation was on predictive density estimation where we established some new minimax decision theoretic phenomena. During my phd, I also collaborated on emerging single-cell virology applications. After graduation, I worked on emprical Bayes theory and methods and have developed efficient shrinkage methods for big-data estimation problems. Along with these research areas, currently I am also interested in the development and theoretical analysis of shrinkage methods for large-scale hierarchical modeling.  These methods are inspired by contemporary research problems in pricing strategy and digital marketing that involve large-scale non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Below is a list of the different topics that I'm currently working.

**Statistics Theory and Methods** 
  - Predictive Inference 
    - Predictive Density Estimation
    - Impact of Loss functions on optimality of predictors
  - High-dimensional Decision Theory 
    - Shrinkage and Empirical Bayes 
    - Minimax optimality   
    - Sparse Estimation and Penalized Regression methods  

**Applications and Statistical Methods**
  - Single Cell Virology
    - Inference under heterogeneity; Clustering 
    - Two sample Testing
  - Pricing Strategies and Digital Marketing
    - Mixed-effects models and joint modeling
    - Bayesian Shrinkage in Hierarchical models; 
  - Inventory Management 
    - Quantile and Asymmetric losses

I am an Assistant Professor of Data Sciences and Operations in the University of Southern California. I am a member of the USC Marshall Statistics Group. I graduated from Stanford University with a Statistics PhD in 2013, after defending <a href='http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gourab/gourab-thesis.pdf'><i><font face="verdana" color="teal">this thesis</font></i></a>.  My advisor at Stanford was  <a href='http://statweb.stanford.edu/~imj/'><font face="verdana" color="teal"> Iain Johnstone</font></a>. Prior to that, I studied at <a href='http://www.isical.ac.in'><font face="verdana" color="teal">Indian Statistical Institute</font></a> for my  Bachelor's and Master's degrees.

<br/>
<b>Research Interests:</b>  
My research interests include high-dimensional statistics, empirical Bayes &amp shrinkage methods, penalized regression and statistical prediction analysis. I am particularly interested in formulating new Bayes and empirical Bayes methods with optimal frequentist properties in estimation and prediction problems. I am also involved in developing novel statistical algorithms for big-data applications in health-care and management sciences. These applications involves two-sample inferences, data-driven segmentations and dynamic predictions which are again compounded with heterogeniety and sparsity issues.

<br/>
&#9658; <b>Applications:</b> Single-Cell Virology, Inventory Management, Optimal Pricing of digital goods.
