I am an Assistant Professor of Data Sciences and Operations in the University of Southern California. I am a member of the USC Marshall Statistics Group. I graduated from Stanford University with a Statistics PhD in 2013, after defending <a href='http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gourab/gourab-thesis.pdf'><i><font face="verdana" color="teal">this thesis</font></i></a>.  My advisor at Stanford was  <a href='http://statweb.stanford.edu/~imj/'><font face="verdana" color="teal"> Iain Johnstone</font></a>. Prior to that, I studied at <a href='http://www.isical.ac.in'><font face="verdana" color="teal">Indian Statistical Institute</font></a> for my  Bachelor's and Master's degrees.

<b>Research Interests:</b>  
My research interests include high-dimensional statistics, empirical Bayes &amp shrinkage methods, penalized regression and statistical prediction analysis. I am particularly interested in formulating new Bayes and empirical Bayes methods with optimal frequentist properties in estimation and prediction problems. I am also involved in developing novel statistical algorithms for big-data applications in health-care and management sciences. These applications involves two-sample inferences, data-driven segmentations and dynamic predictions which are again compounded with heterogeniety and sparsity issues.

&#9658; <b>Methods:</b> Predictive Inference, Empirical Bayes and Shrinkage Methodology, Sparse Estimation, Cross-classified models, Mixed-effects modeling
<br/>
&#9658; <b>Applications:</b> Single-Cell Virology, Inventory Management, Optimal Pricing of digital goods.
