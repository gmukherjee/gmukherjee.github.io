## Bio

I graduated from Stanford University with a Statistics phd after defending [this thesis](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gourab/gourab-thesis.pdf). I was advised by Professor [Iain Johnstone](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~imj/). My dissertation was on predictive density estimation and we found some new minimax decision theoretic phenomena in the prediction regime that contrasted with  sparse estimation results. During my phd, I also collaborated on single-cell virology applications with Professors Ann Arvin's and Harry Greenberg's labs in the Stanford Medical School and Palo Alto's Veterans Affairs Hospital. Upon graduation, I had the good fortune of working and learning general shrinkage principles and empirical Bayes ideas from Professor [Lawrence Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_D._Brown). Compared to minimax shrinkage rules, these generic shrinkage methods are more tractable and scalable. They can be used to answer science and policy questions in experiments and instances that involve inferences and predictions based on big-data sets. Theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of traditional shrinkage algorithms is built on some of the most elegant and seminal works in statistical decisions theory. We established new results characterizing the efficacy of shrinkage in modern large-scale applications and big-data regimes. Building on these results, we are now working towards a robust inferential framework for the disciplined development and analysis of shrinkage methods that take into account the increasing complexities of the data. Currently, in some applied collaborative works with my marketing colleagues that involve large-scale mixed-effects and non-linear hierarchical modeling, we are using some of these perspectives to find optimal ways of incorporating shrinkage in digital marketing problems.

## Research Summary

I am interested in developing new statistical theories and perspectives that enhance our understanding on the working principles of popular data mining hacks and algorithms. Nowadays, data analysts are increasingly using innovative techniques to address the fundamental estimation and prediction challenges associated with big-data problems. Theoretical analysis of  these methods is very important for disciplined development of algorithms in these new age problems. In this context, I study the methods used for predictive modelling and analyze how these prediction problems differ from traditional estimation frameworks and why algorithm specifically geared for prediction should be used for predictive analysis. Another interesting attribute here involves checking the statistical consistency of the decision rules in high dimensions as increasing number of parameters are used for modeling.  We often use the minimal worst-case  (minimax) risk as the benchmark  for comparing the prediction accuracy of these methods. These theoretical analysis has lead to the formulation of new Bayes and empirical Bayes methods with optimal frequentist properties in estimation and prediction problems.  

I am also interested in developing novel statistical methods for emerging application areas in business and sciences. Over years, blessed by wonderful collaborators I have been introduced to statistical modeling in single-cell biology, inventory management and recently in marketing. These new age big-data applications of statistical methods need incorporating novel notions of shrinkage for constructing robust algorithms and predictors. The concept of shrinkage is important because it provides an elegant framework for combining information and structures from related populations and often leads to substantial improvements in the performances of algorithms used for simultaneous inference.  Here, the attributes of interest involve two-sample inferences, data-driven segmentations and dynamic predictions in data-models that are compounded with heterogeniety and sparsity issues.  

These two dual trajectories usually bootstrap each other stimulating interesting new research questions in either domains. Below is an itemized list of the sub-topics of interest:
