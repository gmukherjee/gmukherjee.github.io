In Fall 2019, I will be teaching a graduate level class on Regression and Generalized Linear Models for Business Applications. 
The class will be from 12:30-1:50pm on Mondays and Wednesdays in HOH 506. 
It will cover large-scale statistical methods and algorithms that are increasingly being used in data science.     
Phd and masters' students with quantative backgrounds and interests may take this class. My last year's class materials can be accessed by clicking <a href="https://gmukherjee.github.io/gsba604/">this link</a>.

  I used to have files and links with the url: http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gourab/. However, the bcf file system has now been retired by USC and so those links are inactive now. The new link to those files can be found in my Research page.
