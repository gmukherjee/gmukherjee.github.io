I am an Assistant Professor of Data Sciences and Operations in the University of Southern California. I am a member of the USC Marshall Statistics Group. 
My research interests are in statistical theory and applications. On the theory side, I am interested in statistical decision theory and on research projects that involve 
rigorous analysis of the optimality of statistical methods. On the applied side, I am interested in contemporary applications of statistics in virology and marketing.  
These applied and theory interests often bootstrap each other stimulating interesting new research perspectives.  
Some details about these activities can be found in my bio page. 
The links to published papers and preprints can be accessed from my research page.

3. In Fall 2021, I will teach GSBA 604 which is a graduate level class on Regression and Generalized Linear Models for business applications. 
It will cover large-scale statistical methods and algorithms that are increasingly being used in data science.
Frequentist likelihood based inferences as well as Bayesian modeling approaches and computations will be covered. 
Phd and masters' students with quantative backgrounds and interests may take this class.
