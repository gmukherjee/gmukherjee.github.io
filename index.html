I am an Assistant Professor of Data Sciences and Operations in the University of Southern California. I am a member of the USC Marshall Statistics Group. I graduated from Stanford University with a Statistics PhD in 2013, after defending <a href='http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gourab/gourab-thesis.pdf'><i><font face="verdana" color="teal">this thesis</font></i></a>.  My advisor at Stanford was  <a href='http://statweb.stanford.edu/~imj/'><font face="verdana" color="teal"> Iain Johnstone</font></a>. Prior to that, I studied at <a href='http://www.isical.ac.in'><font face="verdana" color="teal">Indian Statistical Institute</font></a> for my  Bachelor's and Master's degrees.
